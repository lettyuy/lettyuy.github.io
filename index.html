          <p class="body-text">
            Circle AI Seller Recs is a conversational decision-support prototype designed to help small retailers discover and operationalize trending product ideas. It intelligently shifts
            between trend-driven recommendations and practical business guidance, demonstrating how AI can function as a modular decision layer rather than a static chatbot.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            In this view, recommendations are drawn exclusively from a predefined trend dataset, preventing hallucinated or irrelevant suggestions. The assistant adheres to structured output
            rules, ensuring each card includes summary, relevance, and execution steps.
          </p>

               class="circle-ai-image" />

          <p class="body-text">
            When the user asks an operational question (e.g., ingredients for a specific drink), the assistant switches into advisory mode and suppresses visual cards entirely.
            The response remains conversational and practical. This dual-mode behavior reflects thoughtful UX design: the interface avoids unnecessary visual clutter when ideation is not required.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot 2 -->
          <img src="./assets/images/seller-recs-2.png" 
               alt="Advisory mode without cards"
               class="circle-ai-image" />

          <p class="body-text">
            Here, the assistant moves beyond beverages and into complementary revenue opportunities, recommending pastry pairings that enhance both flavor and presentation.
            The card structure ensures suggestions remain consistent, actionable, and visually scannable.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot 3 -->

               class="circle-ai-image" />

          <p class="body-text">
            When the user asks for seasonal guidance, the system shifts into ideation mode, generating structured trend cards instead of a simple text response. Each card
            contains a summary, relevance context, and actionable next steps, transforming abstract trends into operational menu experiments.
          </p>

          <!-- Screenshot 4 -->

          <h3 class="subheader-text">Potential Applications</h3>

          <p class="body-text">
            In a production environment, this system could integrate real-time social listening signals by surfacing emerging flavors, aesthetic movements, seasonal conversations,
            and local neighborhood buzz, and merge them with internal sales data.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            By combining trend velocity, review sentiment, weather patterns, and event data, the assistant could recommend menu shifts and limited-time offerings
            aligned with what customers are actively responding to in the moment.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            Rather than reacting to trends after they peak, sellers could proactively test, bundle, and promote items informed by live cultural signals and performance metrics.
            Over time, this evolves into an adaptive intelligence layer — helping small retailers translate social insight into operational action, from menu development to
            inventory planning and on-the-go decision-making.

        <h2 class="subheader-text">My Background</h2>

        <div class="about-content">

          <p class="body-text">
            I began my career studying apparel and graphic design, where I learned
            to think visually, build with intention, and design around the end user.
            I spent over six years in fashion design and product development,
            bringing concepts to life from ideation to launch.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            Over time, I became increasingly curious about the data behind product
            decisions — especially the voice of the customer. I found myself drawn
            to social listening, pattern recognition, and the signals beneath the surface.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            That curiosity led me to pursue a master’s degree in Business Analytics
            and transition into consulting. Today, I work with a Fortune 1 client
            focusing on trend intelligence and insight-driven strategy.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            I enjoy building tools, refining systems, and designing workflows that
            make decision-making clearer and more effective — blending creative thinking
            with analytical rigor.
