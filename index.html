          <p class="body-text">
            I began my career studying apparel and graphic design, where I learned
            to think visually, build with intention, and design around the end user.
            I spent over six years in fashion design and product development,
            bringing concepts to life from ideation to launch.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            Over time, I became increasingly curious about the data behind product
            decisions — especially the voice of the customer. I found myself drawn
            to social listening, pattern recognition, and the signals beneath the surface.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            That curiosity led me to pursue a master’s degree in Business Analytics
            and transition into consulting. Today, I work with a Fortune 1 client
            focusing on trend intelligence and insight-driven strategy.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            I enjoy building tools, refining systems, and designing workflows that
            make decision-making clearer and more effective — blending creative thinking
            with analytical rigor.
