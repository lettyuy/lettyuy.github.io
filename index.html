        <span class="subheader-text">My Background / About Me</span>

        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">
            I began my career studying apparel and graphic design, where I learned
            to think visually, build with intention, and design around the end
            user. I went on to spend over six years in fashion design and product
            development, bringing concepts to life and working across the full
            lifecycle from ideation to launch.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">
            During that time, I became increasingly curious about the data behind
            product decisions — especially the voice of the customer. I found
            myself drawn to social listening, customer reviews, and trend signals:
            What were customers actually saying? What patterns were emerging
            beneath the surface? How could we use those insights to build better
            products?
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">
            That curiosity led me to pursue a master’s degree in Business Analytics
            and transition into consulting. Today, I work with a Fortune 1 client
            focusing on trend intelligence, analyzing large-scale data to surface
            emerging themes, consumer sentiment, and strategic opportunities.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">
            What I enjoy most is ideating solutions — whether that’s shaping
            product concepts, building insight tools, or refining systems that
            make decisions easier and more informed. I’m motivated by solving
            real problems, improving user experiences, and creating work that is
            both functional and well-designed.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">
            My background allows me to bridge creativity and analytics: I bring a
            designer’s empathy, a product developer’s execution mindset, and a
            data-driven approach to iteration and strategy.
